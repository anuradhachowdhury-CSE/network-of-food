            <p>Hello I am Anu. In a world of plenty, nobody should go to bed hungry. Yet the 2020 Report of the State of
                Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI 2020) reports that global hunger has been on the rise
                since 2014. Beyond hunger, we have a bigger problem looming over our heads: poor diet, which is now the
                biggest contributor to disease and death. SOFI 2020 presented the grim statistic that 3 billion of the
                world’s population cannot afford the cheapest healthy diet and must depend on poor-quality diets.</p>

        <p>Food systems involve the entire range of activities by which food finally reaches the table: production,
            harvesting, storage, processing, distribution, retailing, consumption, and disposal. There are many
            institutions and businesses that comprise food systems; consumers are also a significant part.</p>
